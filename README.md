# skullsweeper
Babie's first game deving hours: a recreation of Minesweeper but with some theming patterned after the Toontown Online skullsweeper minigame.

This is just easy-mode minesweeper at the moment. Game starts on open, there are 7 mines in every game, uncover every other tile without clicking any skull tiles to win. The exe export itself was too fat to commit here (even zipped) so project files are necessary, but included the console exe file for easy launching (probably, idk how this crap works yet).

Snooping on the files is of course fine, but don't use any of them as learning tools unless it's a cautionary lesson. Both the skull and retry assets, however, took me like 5 minutes total to make though, and I toss them happily into the public domain river to return to their spawning grounds for the rest of their days. Take them if you like and do as you wish for whatever purpose, no credit necessary.

Extra features like difficulty selection and a true Skullfinder Toontownâ„¢ practice mode possibly to be added in the distant future.
